# Game of Life
The [Game of Life](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Swift) is a   cellular automaton   devised by the British mathematician   John Horton Conway   in 1970.   It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

### Goal
We will offer three versions of GOF code in different languages (Go, Swift, Ruby).

Then introduce a same bug into three version's codes.

Finally, conduct a 10-people experiment about evaluation of the quickest debugging time among these three languages.

The language with quickest debugging time will be the best language in this experiment.

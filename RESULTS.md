# Experiment Results

### Methods

* Use Repl.it (browser based IDE) as the environment for experiment
* Manually time the debugging time
* Manually test and check the correction of code
* Languages: Golang, Swift, Ruby

### Materials

### Observations

### Conclusions

### Threats to Validity

* We did not provide tests to help testers debug. Next time we won't randomly generate the initial states of Game of Life, 
  instead, we will give a specific initial state and corresponding tests so that testers may have a better experience of debugging.

# CSC510 HW3 - Experiment Results

### Methods

* Use Repl.it (browser based IDE) as the environment for experiment
* Manually time the debugging time
* Manually test and check the correction of code
* Languages: Golang, Swift, Ruby

### Materials
* We have used repl for running the programs.
* We used Zoom for the debugging sessions.
* Experiment data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTpD41HFYTBdPIfNccqi8RLYuym_o9d0R2z7HBysICw/edit#gid=0)

### Observations

Each person would select one languag which he is most familiar with, then use other two languages if he still has time.

*For Ruby*

These data are based on the time taken by a person for debugging the **ruby** code.

Average amount of time taken: 16.8 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 10 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 30 minutes

---

*For Go*

These data are based on the time taken by a person for debugging the **Go** code.

![Ruby observations.png](https://github.com/NCSU-S/game-of-life/blob/swe/result_images/Time%20Used%20for%20Go.png)

Average amount of time taken: 13 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 7 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 30 minutes

---

*For Swift*

These data are based on the time taken by a person for debugging the **Swift** code.

Average amount of time taken: 18.66667 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 14 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 25 minutes

---

*Comparison all three languages*

![Ruby observations.png](https://github.com/NCSU-S/game-of-life/blob/swe/result_images/Average%20of%20time%20used%20in%20three%20languages.png)

Average amount of time taken for **ruby** : 16.8 minutes

Average amount of time taken for **go** :  13 minutes

Average amount of time takenfor **Swift**: 18.66667 minutes

### Conclusions

* As the figures show that the average time needed for Go was the least compared to the other two languages like ruby and swift.
* According to the screen recording of people during the lab session, most people sait that it is a bit hart to find bugs in swift.
* In conclusion, we can say that Go is a better language to coding and debuging. The second one is ruby, if people learned a bit of ruby it will be easier to code and debug with it. The last one is Swift.

### Threats to Validity

* We did not provide tests to help testers debug. Next time we won't randomly generate the initial states of Game of Life, 
  instead, we will give a specific initial state and corresponding tests so that testers may have a better experience of debugging.

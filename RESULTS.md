# CSC510 HW3 - Experiment Results

### Methods

* Use Repl.it (browser based IDE) as the environment for experiment
* Manually time the debugging time
* Manually test and check the correction of code
* Languages: Golang, Swift, Ruby

### Materials

### Observations

### Conclusions
* As the figures show that the average time needed for Go was the least compared to the other two languages like ruby and swift.
* According to the screen recording of people during the lab session, most people sait that it is a bit hart to find bugs in swift.
* In conclusion, we can say that Go is a better language to coding and debuging. The second one is ruby, if people learned a bit of ruby it will be easier to code and debug with it. The last one is Swift.

### Threats to Validity

* We did not provide tests to help testers debug. Next time we won't randomly generate the initial states of Game of Life, 
  instead, we will give a specific initial state and corresponding tests so that testers may have a better experience of debugging.
